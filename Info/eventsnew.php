		<DESCRIPTION>A unique event jointly presented by the institute and Internshala,Campus placement or campus interview is the program conducted within educational institutes or in a common place to provide jobs to students pursuing or in the stage of completing the programme. 
		In this programme, industries visit the colleges to select students depending on their ability to work, capability, focus and Aim. 
		The major objective of campus placement is to identify the talented and qualified professionals before they complete their education. 
		This process reduces the time for an industry to pick the candidates according to their need. It is a cumbersome activity and hence majority of the companies find it difficult to trace the right talent. 
		Many students do not understand the importance of placement training that is being imparted, whether it is an aptitude training or soft skills.
		They show the least interest in this due to various factors viz., projects, assignments or more of activities loaded by the colleges as part of their curriculum thinking that it is not useful. 
		It is the responsibility of the companies training on placement to make the students equipped on all aspects of career development along with creating a very good impact in them which makes them feel every minute they spend in the placement training session is worth being there and will help them in getting placed in their dream companies. 
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prizes worth Rs 9000 to be won.  &lt;/b&gt;

		<TITLE>Innovation through Waste</TITLE>
		<TAGLINE></TAGLINE>
		<IMAGE>itw.png</IMAGE>
		<DESCRIPTION>With the entire world emphasizing on essentiality of nurturing within oneself, an efficient manager, it becomes even more crucial that the waste existing on this globe is administered on priority. 
		Waste management stands as one of the debated political and environmental agenda.
		The ingredient demanded for the task to be accomplished is innovation, an idea to convert anything that can be regarded as waste into something that is creative and cool.
		The prime expectation from the participants in this event is innovation, rather than research. 
		While research is the exploration into the unknown where outcomes are not defined and are unsure, Innovation, is the application of Research. 
		Thus, the event,powered by Internshala, aims at providing the knowledgeable youth an opportunity, to apply the existing technologies to transform 'waste to worthy'.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prizes worth Rs 15000+ internship opportunity by CollegeFever to be won. &lt;/b&gt;

</DESCRIPTION>	
		<RULES>&lt;h5&gt;Only registered users at http://infotsav.com/ can participate &lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As soon as you register, you become a freelancer/software engineer/project leader who gets paid for completing tasks of various companies. The user is virtually provided with a laptop of basic configuration with fully charged battery. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The criteria for completing a task include your battery level and fulfillment of minimum requirements by a task which may include various software and hardware.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tasks are categorized into four levels. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User will get paid for completing a task and gains experience associated with that task.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The battery gets consumed in doing a task/job. If battery gets over, one needs to wait for some time to recharge the battery or buy a power booster for the laptop for instant recharge. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User can upgrade his/her system by buying available packages (hardware and software). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The basis of ranking is the "experience" gained by the user. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are three basic tasks kept for the user in case if he runs out of money. These tasks will not give him experience. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is only one round. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prior  to the main  round two trials round will be held(no points will be awarded for these rounds) &lt;/li&gt;

		<DESCRIPTION> &lt;b&gt;Problem Statement: &lt;/b&gt;
		According to the conventional legend the islands of Zentia, was once under the rule of a king and had been very prestigious nation with immense wealth. The sea was the only link between zentia and the  other lands surrounding it. As the news of the states' prosperity spread, several armies of the neighbouring islands and nations began initiating wars to conquer the wealthy islands which lead to the complete destruction of the life and property of Zentia. But during the war the clever king had buried the treasure underground. The war ended, the islands desolated but the treasure could not be reached.After a long time the quest to grab the riches of the state has begun again. The knowledgeable folks of Persovia, the island nearest to Zentia, have got acquainted to the old tail and have succeeded in the constructing a bridge connecting the two nations. To check the reliability of the bridge it was proposed that a line follower robot, an autonomous bot which follows either black line in white area or white line in black area, should be developed, which can traverse the bridge accurately and guide the citizens of Persovia to the treasure. 
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prizes worth Rs 11000 to be won. &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Objective: &lt;/b&gt;
		Make a black line following robot. The time taken by the bot to traverse through the course will be one of the concrete criteria for determining the winner. The lesser the time taken the better the points gained by the bot.  If nobody finish the run, the farthest one run on tracks with maximum points will win.  
        </DESCRIPTION>	
		<RULES>&lt;b&gt;Bot Specifications: &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Maximum size of a robot : 25*25*25 cm,&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Maximum weight : 3 kg, &lt;/li/br&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;Note:&lt;/u&gt; Dimensional and weight limits for robots shall be strictly enforced. Robots will have to pass inspection prior to competing. The robot has to be completely autonomous. Once a robot has crossed the starting line it must remain fully autonomous, or it will be disqualified.  
        &lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Course Specifications: &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; The line following course shall traverse a white rectangle. The line shall be black, 30 mm wide. &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; There shall be a starting area at the beginning of the course and an exit area at the end. The line course starts inside the starting area and ends inside the exit area. The start and end points of the line course shall be clearly marked via a transverse line. &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Sharp angles may occur, but will not be smaller than 90° and the tracks may also be composed of some curves and broken lines, hurdles, obstacle  (motile or non-motile both) &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;General Rules : &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; A team can have 2 - 4 members, out of which maximum of 1 can be allowed in the arena. &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; The event will be conducted in two level, and top 10 teams in the leader board will be eligible for the final round.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Once a robot has crossed the starting line it must remain fully autonomous, or it will be disqualified. &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Any robot that loses the line course must reacquire the line at the previous Checkpoint where it was lost, or at any earlier (e.g. already traversed Checkpoint).  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Bot must not lose any parts in the arena or collide with any other bot during the competitions, this will lead to disqualification. &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Any Damage to Arena, other team bot will lead to direct disqualification. &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Battery and Power:   &lt;/b&gt;
		The robot can be powered electrically only. The electric voltage between 2 points anywhere in the robot should not be more than 12 V DC at any point of time.  All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct disqualification.

		<DESCRIPTION> &lt;b&gt;Introduction &lt;/b&gt;
		Crime Lord CHAN has captured the Queen MOMO and you, BITTU, the hero are the chosen one to rescue the queen and win her heart. So, buckle up with all your valor and courage to beat crime lord CHAN's challenge.  
        But, there are many others who tend to save the queen by winning the challenges and saving her from CHAN's atrocities.  
        So, Crime Lord, CHAN has setup a "Race of Galactica" which possesses various obstacles and hurdles to slow you down. So, brace up and let the adrenaline flow through. Feel the blazing wheels and get going. Hail, "BITTU". May the stars be with you.  
        Construct Your Machine to have the maximum speed to beat another machines on the given track to reach the final destination in minimum time.  
        You have to build a manually controlled robot capable of traversing over different terrain and unseen hurdles presented by Crime Lord CHAN.  
        There will be separate points for overcoming the obstacles as well as the other parameter being within time. Thus the bot with the most cumulative points will win.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prizes worth Rs 11000 to be won. &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;TASK &lt;/b&gt;
		Design and construct a remote controlled  (wired/wireless) robot capable not only running fast but also is capable of fighting hurdles on the track in the least time. 
		
        </DESCRIPTION>	
		<RULES>&lt;b&gt;Bot Specifications: &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Only wheels are allowed for locomotion, conveyer belts may be used. &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; The weight of the bot should not be more than 4kgs (excluding power source). &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; The bot should fit in a box of dimensions 30*25*15 cm.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; At all times, bots behavior should be non-offensive, non-destructive and non-harmful to humans and track.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Bots are not allowed to fly.    &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Internal combustion engine cannot be used.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Also bot must not emit smoke or fire, leak, stain or soil, spray, throw or use projectiles.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Team Specification: &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Any team can participate in Blazing Wheels, Infotsav-2015. A team may consist of 3 to 5 member Participants. These participants can be from same or different institutes.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Team Representative: Each team must specify their Team Representative (Leader) at the time of registration on the website.   &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; All important communications between organizers and the registered teams will be done through Team Representative.    &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Track Specification: &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; The track will be 35-40 cm wide.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; The track will be having many zones and various check points.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;General Rules  &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; The track will contain certain number of checkpoints and if the bot goes out of the track then it has to start with the previous check-point. You can bring back the bot on track for 3 chances maximum.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; There will be certain number of hurdles and obstacles. Each obstacle and hurdle will be assigned some specific points and have to be completed in a stipulated time limit.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Point description will be disclosed on the spot before commencement of event.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; This will be a two round competition and entry to the final round will be solely based on total cumulative points of previous round.     &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; One should not use the wires for lifting up or moving the bot.       &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Points earned will be calculated within the time limit and free time of 3 min will be provided. Only once if any technical problem occurs.   &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; In case of any discrepancies organizer's decision will be final and binding.     &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; The organizers reserve the right to change any or all of the rules as they desire. Change in the rules as if any will be informed through e-mail or via Facebook page        &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Any team found flouting any rules would be automatically disqualified.      &lt;/li&gt;

		<DESCRIPTION> &lt;b&gt;Introduction &lt;/b&gt;
		The Protocol is defined! Robots need to boot up!  
        The field is set! The Town is ready to witness the breathtaking game of Football. So it's time to show off some amazing soccer skills!  
        Can your automaton battle it out on the field with some hard tackles and score blistering goals? Then Gear up and prepare your Bots for the Ultimate Showdown!    
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prizes worth Rs 11000 to be won. &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Problem Statement  &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt; To build manually controlled robot capable of playing soccer on an arena specially designed for robotic soccer match.  
		&lt;br&gt; The robot would compete against others in 1-1 matches. 
        </DESCRIPTION>	
		<RULES>&lt;b&gt;Bot Specifications  &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Both Wired and RC wireless bots are allowed.   &lt;/li&gt;      
		&lt;li&gt; Maximum ROBOT size: 30Cm x 30Cm x 30cm.  &lt;li&gt;  
        &lt;li&gt; The kicking mechanism of robot should not damage the arena.    &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt; The weight limit of the robot for this competition is 5 Kg.   &lt;li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; The design to stretch a robot's body or its parts may be allowed after a match has started, but must remain a single centralized robot.   &lt;li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; The bots can have on board as well as off board power supply (The organizing committee will not provide power supply or any other battery sources.)  &lt;li&gt;  
        &lt;li&gt; The maximum potential difference between any two points on the bot should not exceed 16 volts.     &lt;li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Grabbing the ball is not allowed. So bots should not have any kind of grabbing mechanisms..     &lt;li&gt;
		
		
		
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;General Rules   &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; A team may consist of maximum of 4 members. Students from different institutes may form a team.    &lt;/li&gt;      
		&lt;li&gt; Bots are not supposed to carry/hold the ball.   &lt;li&gt;  
        &lt;li&gt; Ready-made LEGO kits are not allowed.  &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt; No last minute repairs will be allowed in the arena. However, each team can take a time-out of 1 minute once during a match.  &lt;li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Bots would be checked for their safety before the match and may be discarded if found unsafe for other team or spectators.   &lt;li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; All students with a valid identity card of their respective institutes are eligible to participate in the event.  &lt;li&gt;  
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Fouls   &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Any kind of intentional damage caused to opponent team's bot will be considered as foul. Intentional grabbing of the ball so as to make it impossible for other team to get the control of the ball will also be considered as foul.    &lt;/li&gt;      
		&lt;li&gt; A free kick will be given to other team in case of fouls during which bots of the team committing the foul will be freezed for 30 seconds and ball will be given to the other team.    &lt;li&gt;  
        &lt;li&gt; If a foul is committed inside the D-area, penalty will be given.   &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt; Decision of the referee will be final and binding.   &lt;li&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Disqualification   &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; During the Game, the team members should not touch the machine or the arena. Failure to do so will lead to disqualification.    &lt;/li&gt;      
		&lt;li&gt; Team committing repeated fouls will attract disqualification.    &lt;li&gt;  
        &lt;li&gt; The Bot will be liable for disqualification if it causes any kind of damage to the arena.   &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt; Bots should not destroy the opponent Bots. Otherwise will lead to disqualification   &lt;li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Any kind of assistance through edges for locomotion will lead to a disqualification.   &lt;li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;  The teams must get ready 5 minutes before the start of the match. If a team is not ready within the stipulated time, this will lead to disqualification.  &lt;li&gt;  
		
        &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
		Organizers reserve the right to disqualify any team indulging in misbehavior or violating any rules.

		<TAGLINE></TAGLINE>
		<IMAGE>ROBO WAR.png</IMAGE>
		<DESCRIPTION> &lt;b&gt;Problem Statement: &lt;/b&gt;
		World War IV has started. This time this is not the countries but the PLANETS , its not the humans but the ROBOTS. So protect your planet from INTERGALACTIC INVASION .Arena has been set up for the bots so, get ready for the ultimate BATTLE.  May the Best BOT WIN!! 
		The challenge is to create a robot (manually controlled / autonomous) which can defend you from opponents and more importantly can destroy them within a stipulated time.Robo war will be held in two categories,namely  
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Robo War - &lt;/b&gt; The bots with weight between 20-40 kgs and size 60cm x 60cm x 80cm are eligible for this category.    
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mini Robo War - &lt;/b&gt;  The bots with weight less than 20 kgs and size 30cm x 30cm x 30cm are eligible for this category.   

&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prizes worth Rs 18000 to be won. &lt;/b&gt;  
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;TASK: &lt;/b&gt;
		Two bots will fight against each other in the arena. Their aim will be to overpower among opponents and throw them out of the arena, drop into the pit made in the arena. It will have fixed time duration.   
        </DESCRIPTION>	
		<RULES>&lt;b&gt;BOT SPECIFICATIONS  &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Robot dimension &amp; fabrication&lt;/h4&gt;
		The initial dimension of the robot should not exceed 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm for MINI ROBO WAR and 60cm x 60cm x 80cm for the ROBO WAR category . However there is no limitation on robot dimension once the match starts.
		Any machine component should not be detached (intentionally) during any point of the war.
		The weight of the machine should not exceed 20 kg for the MINI WAR category  and between 20kgs - 40 kgs for WAR category(excluding  remote control and remote control wires). 
		In case of a wireless robot, weight will be counted as (0.8 x actual weight).  
		Readymade gear boxes, parts, chassis, control circuits and remote controls can be used. 
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Robot control  &lt;/h4&gt;
		In case of wired bots, the minimum length of the wires should be 10 meters. The wires should remain slack at any instant during the fight. All the wires coming out of the machine should be stacked as a single unit. Also, the wires should be projected 1000 mm above the ground to avoid entanglement.    
        In case of wireless system, it should have a minimum four frequency remote control circuit or two dual control circuits or a transmitter-receiver paired module so that frequency interferences with the opposing team can be avoided (in case of any interference in the wireless systems, they will not be considered for rematch or in the results).    
        Remote controls that are readily available in the market may also be used. 
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Battery &amp; power   &lt;/h4&gt;
		The machine can be powered electrically only. Use of an IC engine in any form is not allowed. Batteries must be sealed, immobilized-electrolyte types (such as gel cells, lithium, NiCad, NiMH, or dry cells).  
		The electrical voltage at any point of time in the machine should not exceed 40 V DC/AC.    230V (AC) power will be provided (wired bots).  
		In case of wireless robot, the batteries should be placed on the robot. In case of wired robots teams can use external batteries.  
		All efforts must be made to protect battery terminals from a direct short and causing a battery fire. Failure to do so will lead to disqualification. 
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Pneumatics and hydraulics   &lt;/h4&gt;
		Participants can use pneumatic and hydraulic weapon systems but use of external pressure/ liquid cylinders  are not allowed. Cylinders should be placed on the robots. 
		The outlet pressure of the source/tank should not exceed 8 bars.  
		Robots  can  use  pressurized,  non-inflammable gases/liquid to initialize their pneumatic mechanisms. 
		The used pressure should be indicated by means of a temporarily fitted pressure gauge or there should be a  provision to measure the cylinder pressure on the robot.    
		You must have a safe way of refilling the system and determining the on board pressure. 
		All pneumatic components on board a robot must be securely mounted. Particular attention must be paid to the pressure vessel mounting and armor to ensure that if ruptured it will not escape the robot. The  terms pressure vessel, bottle, and source tank' are used interchangeably.  
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;h4&gt;Weapon Systems   &lt;/h4&gt;
		Robots can have any kind of cutters, flippers, saws, hammers, lifting devices etc. as weapons, with the following exceptions:     
		&lt;li&gt;Liquid projectiles &lt;/li&gt;      
		&lt;li&gt;Acid based Weapons &lt;/li&gt;  
        &lt;li&gt;EMP generators.   &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Any kind of flammable liquid .&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Flame-producing weapons.  &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Explosives  ,water , Nets, glue or any other entanglement devices &lt;/li&gt;  
        &lt;li&gt;High power magnets or electromagnets &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;TEAM SPECIFICATION &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Each team can have maximum of 4 members.  &lt;/li&gt;      
		&lt;li&gt;During the match only one team-member will participate in competition (active member). He will be controlling the robot. Teams are allowed to switch the active members in different matches. This switch is not allowed in the middle of an on-going match.  &lt;/li&gt;  
        &lt;li&gt; Setup time: 60 seconds. In case a team does not report to the weight and measurement counter before their setup time starts, then the opponents will be declared the winners of that round.      &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt; Also, if a team fails to setup their robot within 60 seconds, then the opponents will be given a walkover. &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/br&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;GENERAL RULES   &lt;/b&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The bot will be inspected for safety before the event begins. It will be discarded from competition, if found unsafe, for the participants or spectators.    &lt;/li&gt;      
		&lt;li&gt;The organizers have the right to change any or all of the rules as they deem fit. Changes in rules, if any, will be highlighted on the website.  &lt;/li&gt;  
        &lt;li&gt;Violation of any of the rules will result in immediate disqualification.   &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Teams that are not ready when called for battle will be considered to have declared a walkover, and will  receive no points.   &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The bot cannot be split into two sub-units. Two distinct parts connected by a flexible cable will be considered separate units.   &lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt; Damaging the arena will lead to immediate disqualification  &lt;/li&gt;  
        &lt;li&gt; Lego kits, readymade kits, car bases and development boards are not permitted. Readymade gear boxes are permitted. In all cases, the judges' decision will be final and binding.   &lt;/li&gt;

		<DESCRIPTION>Do you have the brain of a genius? The
online programming contest is here for
you. Show your programming skills and
provide the best possible solution you
can. After all, life doesn't give a second
chance. So prove yourself on the
battlefield and only then you will be a
great warrior.
This year also a set of demanding
problems awaits one and the standard
has only got tougher and tougher. In
this grueling test the more one solves,
the higher he or she scores.
&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prizes worth Rs 7000 to be won + intern from Internshala.com. &lt;/b&gt;
		
		</DESCRIPTION>	
		<RULES>
&lt;li&gt;This mega event will be hosted at popular coding website. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only students who are studying in graduate and post-graduate level in any
Indian university are eligible for the prizes. Professionals can participate but
are not eligible for the prizes. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please do not discuss strategy, suggestions or tips in the comments during a
live contest. If you are unsure, email us at coderush@infotsav.com &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will receive one point for solving a problem (passing all test cases - no
partial credit), regardless of the level of difficulty of that problem. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Students pursuing graduation and post-graduation in any Indian university are eligible. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can submit solutions as many times as you'd like, there are no penalties
for incorrect submissions. Users are ranked according to the most problems
solved. Ties will be broken by the total time for each user in ascending order
of time. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any participant found having fake information regarding qualification criteria
or profile information shall be immediately disqualified. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After the end of the contest, the test cases and the author's solution would
be available on the page www.facebook.com/Infotsav. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any sort of malicious activity will lead to immediate disqualification of the
participant in question.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The decision of the organizers will be final. No queries in this regard will be entertained. &lt;/li&gt;
