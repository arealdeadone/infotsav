   				<h3>Technical events</h3>
   				<p >Techniche presents one of its most distinguished event- The Lecture Series, which serves as a platform to inspire and motivate thousands of young minds across the world by connecting them with the pioneers in various fields. Students and professors, participants and school children alike, all clamour into the auditorium to interact with illustrious figures from all walks of life who  come under one roof and share their experiences and ideas. The motivation behind the Lecture Series is to showcase a rich spectrum of ideas and behind the scenes of awe inspiring science. It brings you an opportunity to interact with such personalities who are at the helm of changing our world today. Previous speakers who have graced the lecture series include the likes of John C. Mather (The 2006 Physics Nobel Laureate), Lyn Evans (Project Leader, Large Hadron Collider, CERN), Pranav Mistry (The Inventor of 6th Sense Technology), Stephen P. Morse (Chief Architect, Intel 8086 Microprocessor), Richard Stallman (Founder, Free Software Movement), Walter Bender (Ex-Director, MIT Media Labs), etc. Having gained immense popularity over the past few years, it is widely recognized as the biggest and the best lecture series in the entire nation and we are sure that we'll be successful in outdoing ourselves yet again. So come, listen and get inspired!</p>

He is a prolific writer of popular chemistry textbooks such as Physical Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, and Molecular Quantum Mechanics, which are a must have on every engineering student's book shelf.Through books such as "What is Chemistry?", he has forced the world to see what seemed like a fact-rich, largely incomprehensible subject in an entirely different light.</p>

With two space shuttle missions and five space walks, he has achieved feats that most only dream of. Having started out as a Fellow at CERN and teaching mathematics at the Royal Institute of Technology, he was, in 1992 selected to join the European Astronaut Corps. He is the first Swedish citizen in space and also the first person outside of the United States or Russian space programs to participate in more than three spacewalks. 

The striking beauty and the sheer inconceivable quality of his experiences made us extremely proud and equally excited to have him as a keynote speaker.

The man and his words lit up our imagination and sent it rocketing into outer space</p>
