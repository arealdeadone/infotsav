9. If the robot loses the course line then it has to reacquire the line at the point at which the line was lost or an earlier traversed point. If the robot fails to do so it will be one chance to reattempt. The robot must start the course again from the beginning, and if it loses the line course on its second attempt it will be disqualified.<br>
