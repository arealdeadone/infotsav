		<DESCRIPTION>Witch hunt, the debugging contest is not only about programming talent but also about applying the sheer knowledge to rectify errors.The challenge tests a programmer's ability to understand and respond to dissimilar codes. The art of rectification / debugging is difficult than conventional programming because it's not about what you know, it's about how much you know and how you apply those cognitive ideas to recognize errors and act upon them. The event tests the programmer in areas of speed, intellect and understanding. A programmer stands nowhere if takes ages to understand and device an algorithm, hence it requires to comply!
The ability to perceive the programming style different from one's own takes some doing and if you are up against the challenge, better get started by becoming a part of Witch Hunt.

		<DESCRIPTION>Brouhaha is the advertising contest that is
held under Infotsav. It is a noisy clamorous response to a stimulus, produced by a crowd. 
It can also refer to the reaction expressed over a period of time to an event.&lt;p&gt;Advertising is a form of communication that
typically attempts to persuade potential customers to purchase or to consume more of a
particular brand of product or service. Advertisements are designed to generate increased
consumption of those products and services through the creation and reinforcement of
"brand image" and "brand loyalty". Every major medium is used to deliver these
messages, including television, radio, cinema, magazines, newspapers, video games, the
Internet and billboards.&lt;/p&gt;</DESCRIPTION>

		<IMAGE>C Infotsav Quiz.png</IMAGE>
		<DESCRIPTION>A quiz is a qualitative as well as a quantitative juncture of accessing your know-how. This is a fantastic mixture of the level of quality and knowledge, which along with checking your knowledge also tests your skills acquired. As far as it is concerned of  C and C++,on one side, where C is an imperative (procedural) language and like most imperative languages in the ALGOL tradition, C has facilities for structured programming and allows lexical variable scope and recursion, whereas on the other hand C++ is a statically typed, free-form, multi-paradigm, compiled, general-purpose programming language and is one of the most popular programming languages which is implemented on a wide variety of hardware and operating system platforms. For the same cause and with the same enthusiasm, we are here on the platform of Infotsav. Get yourself boost up, with the basics as well as the hidden lethal concepts of computer programming. And we guarantee, you are surely going to witness a new phase of concepts.</DESCRIPTION>
